# Deployment Simulator

## Description
This Python script simulates a basic deployment process. It prints deployment steps such as specific version to a given environment, running database migrations, updating configurations files, and restarting application servers.

## Usage:
1. Run the script using Python: `python deploy_script.py
2. Enter the deployment environment when prompted (e.g., production, staging, development).
3. Enter the version to deploy when prompted.
4. The script will simulate the deployment process and print the corresponding steps.

## Notes:
- This is a simulation and does not perform actual deployment actions.
- Customize the script based on your deployment process and requirements.
- Feel free to integrate this script with real deployment tools or processes in your DevOps workflow.
